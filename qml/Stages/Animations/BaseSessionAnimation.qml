/* This is the base case for surface animations, used when adding/removing * child surfaces.
 * The class is meant to be overridden and changes/animations provided for state changes.
 * NB. It is important to release the surface at the end of the "out" animation.
 *
 * Example - Simple fade in/out
 *
 * BaseSurfaceAnimation {
 *     outChanges: [ PropertyChanges { target: animation.surface; opacity: 0.0 } ]
 *     outAnimations: [
           SequentialAnimation {
 *             NumberAnimation { target: animation.surface; property: "opacity"; duration: 300 }
 *             ScriptAction { script: { if (animation.parent.removing) animation.surface.release(); } }
 *         }
 *     ]
 *
 *     inChanges: [ PropertyChanges { target: animation.surface; opacity: 1.0 } ]
 *     inAnimations: [ NumberAnimation { target: animation.surface; property: "opacity"; duration: 300 } ]
 * }
